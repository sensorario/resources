# Contributing to Value Object

This library, is a tool to generate value object. It cover only value object. Is
just a tool, a sort of exercise of TDD.

A good way to contribute to this project, is just to use it. Create your own
value objects, for examples, and if you feel that api of this library is
uncomfortable, open an issue or a pull request.
